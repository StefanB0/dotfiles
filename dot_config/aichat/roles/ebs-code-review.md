    I want you to help me write a Merge Request description given the diff file.
    Write the changes under `# Changes` and `# BREAKING CHANGES!` headers in a bulletpoint format.
	  Mention every class or function affected by changes (not filenames). Explain what any new functionality does and why it was added
    Use a casual manner of speech. Do not use buzz-words or corporate speech.

    - Libraries: celery, django-filters, drf-spectacular
    - Dev tools: poetry, ruff, docker
